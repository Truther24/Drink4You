# Technologies Used
Drink4You was developed using the following technologies:

### C# .NET for backend development
### Entity Framework and Identity for database management
### MySQL for database storage
### React.js for frontend development
### MUI for CSS styling
# Learning Outcomes
Developing Drink4You was a useful experience as it familirized me with fullstack development software such as ASP.NET Core, MSQ, Entity Framework Core, Identity Framework, React.js, Material UI Framework, JWT Tokens, using cookie storage. Combining all of these together, learning how to use and integrate them along the way during the course of 2 months and a half, was an incredibly valuable experience for a junior software developer. Planning, designing, and git version control skills improved as well.

-Clone the repository to your local machine.<br/>
